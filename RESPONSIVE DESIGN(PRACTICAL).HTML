            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends, neighbors, and fellow dreamers,today, I stand before you not just as an individual, but as a voice—a voice among millions, a voice that refuses to be silenced, a voice that carries the weight of hope, resilience, and transformation. And I ask each of you today: What kind of world do we want to build? What kind of future do we dare to fight for? We live in a time where challenges are great, but so is our strength. Every day, we see injustices, inequalities, and divisions that threaten to shake the foundations of what we know. But let me tell you this: History is shaped by those who refuse to accept things as they are. It is shaped by the bold, by the fearless, by those who rise and say, “Enough. We demand better. We deserve better.</p>
